# Imported Prompt
Scene: A quiet community garden at golden hour, warm sunlight filtering through the leaves of climbing vines.

Subject: A teenage girl in a soft yellow sundress stands beside a weathered wooden shed draped in roses.

Action:
– She gently plucks a freshly bloomed red rose from a vine.
– Turns toward the camera with a warm, genuine smile.
– Extends the rose forward as if offering it to the viewer.

Camera & Movement:
– Start with a medium shot capturing her and the shed in soft focus.
– Slowly dolly in to a close-up on her face and the rose.
– Maintain a shallow depth of field so her smile and the red petals stay razor-sharp.

Mood & Atmosphere:
– Birds chirp faintly in the background, bees hover around nearby flowers.
– A soft breeze stirs her hair and the petals.
– Overall tone is natural, intimate, and heartfelt.

Lighting & Color:
– Golden-hour light casts a gentle glow on her skin.
– Rich reds of the rose contrast with the pastel yellow of her dress.
– Subtle lens flares and warm color grading enhance the realism.

Result: A cinematic, heartwarming portrait of a girl smiling at the camera as she presents a red rose in a real-world garden setting.```
